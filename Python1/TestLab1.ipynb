    "### 1. An Introduction to the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This first session will cover the basics of Python, and introduce elements that will help you get familiar with Python as an interactive computational environment for exploring data. The material is presented in an interactive environment that runs within your web browser, called a Jupyter Notebook. It allows presentation of text and graphics to be combined with Python code that can be run interactively, with the results appearing inline. We are looking at a Jupyter notebook now. Note that Jupyter is a relatively recent name for this so sometimes you may still see it referred to as an IPython noteboook. Jupyter is just the new version of IPython notebooks, but now also supports a variety of other languages and tools.\n",

    "In this course we will be using hosted computing facilities to make it easy to start learning to code in Python and to leverage university computing infrastructure. In class we will use datahub, and you can use a Calnet login to connect it at http://datahub.berkeley.edu."

    "\n",
    "Once you launch the Jupyter Notebook, and the Notebook opens up in your browser, you will be looking at a directory of the folder you were in when you launched the notebook. you can either load an existing notebook if you see one in the directory, or create a new one. \n",

    "### 1.4 Learning the Python Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a language, and like natural human languages, it takes time to learn.  There is vocabulary, or \"syntax,\" as well as rules for how that syntax is presented.  Both of these just take practice, practice, practice.  We will teach you the rules, but you need to practice on your own. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, programming languages differ from natural language in one important way:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The rules are rigid. If you're proficient in a natural language, you can understand a non-proficient speaker, glossing over small mistakes. A computer running Python code is not smart enough to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you write code, you'll make mistakes. Errors are okay; even experienced programmers make many errors. When you make an error, you just have to find the source of the problem, fix it, and move on. Fixing it can take a long time.  A long long time."

If you're working in Excel, you don't need to go outside of the program to insert a \"square root of the sum of squares\" equation, for example.  It's a function in Excel. With open source software, different functions were created by different programmers, and we often have to \"call\" in that external program to do what we want. These are often called libraries.\n",

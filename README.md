Files for CP201A: Planning Methods Gateway, UC Berkeley

I am an associate professor of City Planning at UC Berkeley, where I teach the introduction to methods gateway.  This year, I will be teaching the students all of their statistics in Python.  This will be an adventure, since I've never used Python or Github before!
